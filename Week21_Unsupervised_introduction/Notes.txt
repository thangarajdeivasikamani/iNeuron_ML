1.Form the PDF we can see the circule data in the first row- Are we able to separte (Means inner cirecle & ourder circle) -No
But DBSCAN will provide better result.

Similar way we can each algo is defined for differnt differnt data set.

2.Second DBSCAN Will separte two scatter data very well.
3. Third dataset - DBScan provide very good result with outlier(black) info.
4. Fourth data set - DB Scan 
5. Simple data set - Every one provide good result.
6. Only one box - no need cluster - K-means provide cluster - But DBSCAN Provide better result .( Consider single box as it is)


OPTICS = Time more - expensive.
